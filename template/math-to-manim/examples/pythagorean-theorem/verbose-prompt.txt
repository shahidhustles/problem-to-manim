# Manim Animation: Pythagorean Theorem

## Overview
This animation builds the Pythagorean theorem from first principles through a carefully
constructed knowledge tree. Each concept is explained with mathematical rigor
and visual clarity, building from foundational ideas to advanced understanding.

**Total Concepts**: 7
**Progression**: angles -> sides of a triangle -> right triangle -> multiplication -> squares and area -> equality -> Pythagorean theorem
**Estimated Duration**: 100 seconds (1:40)

## Animation Requirements
- Use Manim Community Edition (manim)
- All LaTeX must be in raw strings: r"$\frac{a}{b}$"
- Use MathTex() for equations, Text() for labels
- Maintain color consistency throughout
- Ensure smooth transitions between scenes
- Include voiceover-friendly pacing (2-3 seconds per concept introduction)

## Scene Sequence

### Scene 1: Angles
**Timestamp**: 0:00 - 0:10

Begin by fading in a simple angle visualization to establish our geometric foundation. Create two Line() objects meeting at a point, forming an angle. Use YELLOW for the angle arc created with Arc() and WHITE for the label. Display the notation r"$\theta$" using MathTex() positioned next to the arc with .next_to().

Draw the angle arc using Create(arc) over 1 second, then Write() the theta symbol. Briefly indicate that angles measure rotation between lines. Use FadeIn for the explanatory Text("Angles measure rotation") in WHITE, positioned at the bottom.

Wait 2 seconds for comprehension, then FadeOut all elements except leave a subtle indication that we'll build on this concept.

### Scene 2: Sides of a Triangle
**Timestamp**: 0:10 - 0:22

Transition by creating a triangle using Polygon() in BLUE. Position it at ORIGIN. Clearly label each side with Text() objects: "a", "b", and "c" in GREEN color. Use .next_to() to position labels adjacent to their respective sides.

Animate the triangle creation using Create(triangle) over 2 seconds. Then sequentially Write() each label with 0.5 second delays between them. This establishes the naming convention we'll use throughout.

Emphasize that these are the three sides of any triangle. Display Text("Every triangle has three sides") at the bottom. Wait 1 second, then prepare for the next scene by shifting the triangle to the LEFT.

---

### Scene 3: Right Triangle
**Timestamp**: 0:22 - 0:37

Transform the general triangle into a right triangle using ReplacementTransform(). The right triangle should have the right angle at the lower-left corner. Create a small square marker using Square(side_length=0.2) in YELLOW to indicate the 90-degree angle.

Display r"$\angle C = 90°$" using MathTex() in YELLOW, positioned at the top. FadeIn the right angle marker. Use Indicate() to highlight the marker and the equation simultaneously.

Add labels Text("hypotenuse") next to side c (the longest side, opposite the right angle) and Text("legs") next to sides a and b. Color the hypotenuse label BLUE and the legs label GREEN.

This scene establishes the special property of right triangles that makes the theorem possible.

---

### Scene 4: Multiplication and Area
**Timestamp**: 0:37 - 0:47

Shift focus to area calculation. Create a simple square using Square() in GREEN to demonstrate that area equals side times side. Display r"$A = s \times s = s^2$" using MathTex() in WHITE at the top.

Fill the square with a semi-transparent color using set_fill(GREEN, opacity=0.5). Write the equation, then use Indicate() on the s² term to emphasize the "squared" connection.

This establishes the foundation for understanding squares built on triangle sides.

---

### Scene 5: Squares and Area
**Timestamp**: 0:47 - 1:07

This is a crucial visual scene. Start with the right triangle from Scene 3. Now grow three squares from each side of the triangle using GrowFromEdge():

1. Square on side a: RED with opacity 0.5, grows from the side
2. Square on side b: GREEN with opacity 0.5, grows from the side
3. Square on side c (hypotenuse): BLUE with opacity 0.5, grows from the side

Display the area equations sequentially:
- r"$A_a = a^2$" in RED at upper left
- r"$A_b = b^2$" in GREEN at upper right
- r"$A_c = c^2$" in BLUE at bottom

Use a VGroup() to organize the equations. The visual shows clearly that each side has a corresponding square.

---

### Scene 6: Equality
**Timestamp**: 1:07 - 1:15

Prepare for the key insight. Display r"$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$" in GOLD color using MathTex(), centered and large. This is the Pythagorean theorem equation.

Use Write() animation over 2 seconds. Then use Circumscribe() with GOLD color to highlight the entire equation, drawing attention to this fundamental relationship.

Add Text("The sum of squares on the legs equals the square on the hypotenuse") below, in WHITE.

---

### Scene 7: Pythagorean Theorem - Visual Proof
**Timestamp**: 1:15 - 1:40

This is the culminating scene that brings everything together.

Start by showing the right triangle with all three squares attached (from Scene 5). Now demonstrate the proof visually:

1. Highlight the squares on sides a and b using Indicate() with YELLOW
2. Show their combined area by animating the equation r"$a^2 + b^2$"
3. Transform or morph these two squares to fill the area of the square on side c
4. This visual transformation shows that r"$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$"

Display the final theorem statement in GOLD, large and centered:
r"$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$"

Below it, show the alternative form:
r"$c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$"

Use Circumscribe() on the entire diagram to conclude. Add final text:
Text("The Pythagorean Theorem") in WHITE at the top.

Hold for 3 seconds, then gracefully FadeOut all elements.

have all necessary prerequisites before encountering the main concept.

All visual elements, colors, and transitions have been specified to maintain
consistency and clarity throughout the 100-second animation.

Generate complete, working Manim Community Edition Python code that implements
this scene sequence with all specified mathematical notation, visual elements,
colors, and animations.
